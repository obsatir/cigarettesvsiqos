To obtain the classification with histogram followed by ratio estimator, script_updated.py is needed to be ran. The other needed py files are functions_histogram_classification.py and ratio_estimator.py. Current version of the code takes 2 paths as input, first one is training images (They needed to be renamed as it is mentioned in the comments in the code, eg. 33.70.jpg, 1.232.jpg, where 33 is the class name for HEETS and 1 is for cigarettes.) and test images and returns a dictionary, where the image paths are dicts and its value is 0 if it is classified as a Cigarette, 1 if it is HEETS and 2 if it is not classified.
