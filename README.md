# cigarettesvsiqos

To run the final blackbox, which is binary classification followed by automatic ratio estimator, script.py is needed to be ran. The necessary functions are provided in functions.py and width_height_ratio.py. Currently, there are three prints at the end, first of them is the number of cigarettes, second of them is the number of IQOSes and the last one is number of "Cannot be classified". The prints and the general tidying up will be done next week.
